 I'm particularly interested in dishes that are not very spicy.
Culinary Expert: Absolutely, I'd be happy to recommend a delicious and less spicy Korean dish. One such dish is "Jjigae Bokkeum," also known as "Stir-Fried Jjigae." This dish is a milder version of the popular Korean Jjigae (stew) dishes. It's made with vegetables, tofu, and sometimes seafood or meat, all cooked in a savory soy sauce-based sauce. The dish is typically served over rice. Enjoy your meal!
